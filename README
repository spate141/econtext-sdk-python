eContext API
------------

The eContext API provides easy, quick, and accurate taxonomic classification of
any text content.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the eContext API library from source using the following command: 

 $ python setup.py install

An executable will be installed into your /usr/local/bin directory that may be
used directly from the command line:

 $ echo "Serena Williams Just Grand-Slammed Her Beyonce '7/11' Remake" | econtext-api -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -t text
 $ curl -s http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a14760/real-ebola-vaccine/ | econtext-api -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -t html
 $ echo "http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a14760/real-ebola-vaccine/" | econtext-api -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -t url

You can also specify an input file containing the text or HTML you intend to
classify.

Using the Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the basic level, for each batch of classifiations you would like to run, you
pass in a `requests.session` object containing authorization and content-type
headers to the classification object, specify the data, and then run the batch.

    from econtextapi.client import Client
    from econtextapi.classify import Social

    posts = [
        "A master class in customer service from Lego. Boy writes to Lego after losing a mini-figure. Here's their reply...",
        "This makes me realize how little hope there is for the education system in America.",
        "Perrie just finished decorating the tree I didn't really help :( ha sorry x "
    ]

    client = Client(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
    classify = Social(client)
    classify.set_classify_data(posts)
    results = classify.get_results()
